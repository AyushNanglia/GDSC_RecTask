# gdsc_rec_task

A Firebase integrated Flutter application containing 3 sections viz. Home, Store, Cart.
- Home displays clickable cards with pet info, on clicking the cards, respective availability status can be changed. [Available to Unavailable, not vice-versa]
- Shop displays clickable cards with sample products with their per unit price, on clicking the cards, they get added to the cart. [As of now, only 1 piece per item can be added]
- Cart only displays the list of items added, and on clicking each item, they get removed.

**NOTE:** If the application throws an exception during startup, it can be resolved using Flutter hot reload.
